The stipulations of P2 are simple - develop a full stack web application using all of the recent technology you’ve learned thus far. By “recent” I mean Angular replaces the JS/HTML/CSS front end, and Hibernate replaces good old JDBC. You should implement a front controller to receive all HTTP requests, and find a way to establish user sessions (either manage to get past chrome’s CORS filter, or just use something like firefox.)

The type of application you create is up to you! But allow me to offer some suggestions:

-ECommerce app
-Some kind of text & image style game
-Organization/journaling app
-Blog/forum application
-Trivia/study app

10 minute max presentations, including a powerpoint that explains the purpose of the app and the technology used, as well as a live demo.

EACH PROJECT MUST HAVE 6 CORE FUNCTIONALITIES (login can be one)

Refer to the P2 groups spreadsheet to determine who is on what team/project

3 teams of five associates
3 teams of four associates

Optional Requirements---------------------------------------------

Use the Spring framework to (hopefully) make your development lives easier
Run your application on an EC2 (which we’ll talk about on Wednesday or Thursday)
Get and use data from an external API in order to add more interesting data/functionality to your application 
For instance using the pokeapi to get pokemon objects 
But there are SO MANY apis you can find, my P2 team used a fake shopping api to get images for ecommerce site
I’m not saying replace Java with an external api, but use Java to get some data from an external api. 
DON’T REPLACE YOUR DATABASE WITH THIS
